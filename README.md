# porpoiseful

A system monitor written in Rust

## Prerequisites

Linux with rust-stable toolchain and ideally cargo 

## Installing

For now, clone git repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/aidan-coward/porpoiseful.git
```

Then build it with cargo

```
cd porpoiseful/
```

```
cargo build --release
```

The resulting executable should be `porpoiseful/target/release/porpoiseful`

Maybe one day an AUR package for Arch Linux
